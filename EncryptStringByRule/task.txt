You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

    Your message is a string containing space separated words.
    You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
        The first letter needs to be converted to its ASCII code.
        The second letter needs to be switched with the last letter
    Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in input.

Examples:

EncryptThis("Hello") == "72olle"
EncryptThis("good") == "103doo"
EncryptThis("hello world") == "104olle 119drlo"
